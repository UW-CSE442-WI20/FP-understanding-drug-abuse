name,how,effects
heroin,"People inject, sniff, snort, or smoke heroin. Some people mix heroin with crack cocaine, a practice called speedballing.","Heroin enters the brain rapidly and binds to opioid receptors on cells located in many areas, especially those involved in feelings of pain and pleasure and in controlling heart rate, sleeping, and breathing."
marijuana,"People smoke marijuana in hand-rolled cigarettes (joints) or in pipes or water pipes (bongs). They also smoke it in blunts—emptied cigars that have been partly or completely refilled with marijuana. To avoid inhaling smoke, some people are using vaporizers. These devices pull the active ingredients (including THC) from the marijuana and collect their vapor in a storage unit. A person then inhales the vapor, not the smoke. Some vaporizers use a liquid marijuana extract. People can mix marijuana in food (edibles), such as brownies, cookies, or candy, or brew it as a tea. A newly popular method of use is smoking or eating different forms of THC-rich resins","When a person smokes marijuana, THC quickly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream. The blood carries the chemical to the brain and other organs throughout the body. The body absorbs THC more slowly when the person eats or drinks it. In that case, they generally feel the effects after 30 minutes to 1 hour."
alcohol,"Ethanol is typically consumed as a recreational substance by mouth in the form of alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, and spirits. It is commonly used in social settings due to its capacity to enhance sociability.","The effects of alcohol can range from mild, such as skin flushing, to more severe symptoms such as passing out or vomiting. Other short-term effects of alcohol can include lowered inhibitions, leading to poor social judgment, trouble concentrating, loss of coordination, loss of critical judgement,
dulled perception, especially vision, mood swings, reduced core body temperature, raised blood pressure, passing out, vomiting.


"
meth,"People can take methamphetamine by: smoking, swallowing (pill), snorting, injecting the powder that has been dissolved in water/alcohol","Methamphetamine increases the amount of the natural chemical dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is involved in body movement, motivation, and reinforcement of rewarding behaviors. The drug’s ability to rapidly release high levels of dopamine in reward areas of the brain strongly reinforces drug-taking behavior, making the user want to repeat the experience."
stimulant,"Most prescription stimulants come in tablet, capsule, or liquid form, which a person takes by mouth. Misuse of a prescription stimulant means: taking medicine in a way or dose other than prescribed, taking someone else's medicine, taking medicine only for the effect it causes—to get high","Prescription stimulants increase the activity of the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine. Dopamine is involved in the reinforcement of rewarding behaviors. Norepinephrine affects blood vessels, blood pressure and heart rate, blood sugar, and breathing."
sedative,"Sedatives are a class of drugs that depress, or slow down, the central nervous system. This substance class encompasses a wide variety of drugs, the most common of which include benzodiazepines (treats anxiety and seizures), barbiturates (historically used for anxiety and insomnia; today use is largely reserved as an anti-epileptic drug), prescription hypnotics or sleep aids (insomnia).","Sedatives reduce and slow communication throughout the brain. As an individual withdraws from a persistent period of sedation, a much higher level of neural stimulation may be experienced. This can lead to symptoms like: restlessness. muscle shaking. excessive sweating, nausea or vomiting, insomnia, depression/anxiety. In extreme cases, the user may experience hallucinations, delirium, and potentially fatal seizures."
pain-reliever,"One of the most frequent reasons people go to the doctor is for pain relief. There are a number of different drugs that can ease pain. About 20% of people will get a medication called an opioid. You could also hear your doctor call it an opiate or a narcotic. These pain relievers are made from opium, which comes from the poppy plant. Morphine and codeine are the two natural products of opium.","These drugs are generally safe when you take them for a short time, as prescribed by your doctor. But in addition to helping you manage the pain, they can also give you a feeling of well-being or euphoria. And each of those effects could lead you to misuse the drug or take it in a way your doctor didn’t intend. You might take a higher dose than prescribed, take someone else’s prescription, even for a legitimate problem, like pain, or take it to get high."
oxycontin,"OxyContin is a strong prescription medicine used when an opioid medicine is needed to manage severe pain enough to require daily around-the-clock, long-term treatment with an opioid, when other pain treatments such as non-opioid pain medicines or immediate-release opioid medicines do not treat your pain well enough or you cannot tolerate them.","Nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, weakness, sweating, lightheadedness, dizziness, or drowsiness may occur. Some of these side effects may decrease after you have been using this medication for a while. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly."
crack,"Crack cocaine is the crystal form of cocaine, which normally comes in a powder form.1 It comes in solid blocks or crystals varying in color from yellow to pale rose or white. Crack is heated and smoked. It is so named because it makes a cracking or popping sound when heated.","Smoking crack allows it to reach the brain more quickly and thus brings an intense and immediate—but very short-lived—high that lasts about fifteen minutes. And because addiction can develop even more rapidly if the substance is smoked rather than snorted (taken in through the nose), an abuser can become addicted after his or her first time trying crack."
tranquilizer,"A tranquilizer refers to a drug which is designed for the treatment of anxiety, fear, tension, agitation, and disturbances of the mind, specifically to reduce states of anxiety and tension.","These drugs slow normal brain function, which may result in slurred speech, shallow breathing, sluggishness, fatigue, disorientation and lack of coordination or dilated pupils. Higher doses cause impaired memory, judgment and coordination; irritability; paranoia; and thoughts of suicide. Some people can become agitated or aggressive. Using prescription sedatives and tranquilizers with other substances — particularly alcohol — can slow breathing, or slow both the heart and respiration, and possibly lead to death."
hallucinogen,"Hallucinogens are a diverse group of drugs that alter a person’s awareness of their surroundings as well as their own thoughts and feelings. They are commonly split into two categories: classic hallucinogens (such as LSD) and dissociative drugs (such as PCP). Both types of hallucinogens can cause hallucinations, or sensations and images that seem real though they are not. Additionally, dissociative drugs can cause users to feel out of control or disconnected from their body and environment. Some hallucinogens are extracted from plants or mushrooms, and some are synthetic (human-made). ","Research suggests that classic hallucinogens work at least partially by temporarily disrupting communication between brain chemical systems throughout the brain and spinal cord. Some hallucinogens interfere with the action of the brain chemical serotonin, which regulates: mood, sensory perception, sleep, hunger, body temperature. sexual behavior, intestinal muscle control."
cocaine,"People snort cocaine powder through the nose, or they rub it into their gums. Others dissolve the powder and inject it into the bloodstream. Some people inject a combination of cocaine and heroin, called a Speedball.",Cocaine increases levels of the natural chemical messenger dopamine in brain circuits related to the control of movement and reward.
inhalant,"People who use inhalants breathe in the fumes through their nose or mouth, usually by “sniffing,” “snorting,” “bagging,” or “huffing.” These substances include solvents (liquids that become gas at room temperature), aerosol sprays, gases, nitrites (prescription medicines for chest pain).","People may also feel light-headed or have hallucinations (images/sensations that seem real but aren't) or delusions (false beliefs). With repeated inhalations, many people feel less self-conscious and less in control. Some may start vomiting, feel drowsy for several hours, or have a headache that lasts a while. "
